This project is a simple weather application for android.

Extra features include:
-   when stopping the app, the most recently searched city will be saved in a shared preferences file.  Upon starting the app, the new weather data for that city will be loaded and shown.  A user would likely use the app forprimarily one city so this will save them time from typing in the name of the city every time.
-   when typing the name of a city, either the enter key or the button will trigger the search.
-   the horizontal view is blocked to preserve the placement of information.
-   when the user enters something other than a known city name, an error message appears.
